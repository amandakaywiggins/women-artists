# Know Your Artist

## How many artists do you know?
"Know Your Artist" is a basic javascript hangman style game created to increase awareness of women's contributions to art. Consider the ubiquitousness of the names Van Gogh, Monet, Picasso, Pollack, and Warhol. Now how many women artists can you identify by name? This game strives to introduce users to the rich and wonderful history of women as artists.
